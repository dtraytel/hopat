# Higher-Order Pattern Unification in Isabelle/HOL

Isabelle/HOL formalization of Nipkow's unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns, on de Bruijn lambda-terms. It started from Roman Angehrn's thesis
(`thesis/thesis.pdf`) and now has full termination and correctness proofs,
following Grobauer's pen-and-paper development (Chapter 2). The
lambda-calculus theories start from `HOL/Proofs/Lambda` in the Isabelle
distribution.

## Main results

The algorithm is `unify` (in `thys/Unification.thy`). It is a functional
version of Grobauer's `unif₁`, with on-the-fly η-conversion and the marker
of Section 2.2.1.

- **Termination** (`Unif_Termination.thy`, `unify_terminates`):
  `unify s t` terminates for all patterns `s` and `t`. The proof uses a
  lexicographic measure and an invariant that generalizes Grobauer's
  observations to nested markers.
- **Correctness** (`Unif_Correctness.thy`, `unify_None` and `unify_Some`):
  let `s` and `t` be patterns of the same type.
  - If `unify s t = None`, then no closed, well-typed substitution unifies
    `s` and `t` modulo βη.
  - If `unify s t = Some φ`, then `φ` is a closed unifier of `s` and `t`.
    Every closed, well-typed unifier `σ` factors through `φ`: there is a `γ`
    with `γ(φ F) ≡βη σ F` for every free variable `F` of `s` and `t`.

The single-step results follow Grobauer's Propositions 1–4:

- `otfη_unifies`: on-the-fly η-conversion.
- `cases_more_general`: the computed substitution is more general.
- `cases_same_unifiers`: the new problems have the same unifiers.
- `cases_None`: a failing step has no unifier.

The main induction is `unif_correct` (Propositions 5–7).

The occurs check (Grobauer's Fact 9, `Unif_Occurs.thy`, `occurs_check`)
needs simple types, because it fails for untyped terms. It is proven with a
type-directed measure: the depth of the η-long form of β-normal terms. This
measure is invariant under βη-equivalence and grows strictly below a rigid
head.

Where Grobauer renames bound variables, the formalization instead
instantiates the new variables with abstractions of βη-normal forms of the
given unifier.

## A generated replacement for `pattern.ML`

The session `Pure_Pattern` (directory `thys/Pure_Pattern`) is separate from the
de Bruijn development above. It formalizes the full algorithm of Isabelle's
`src/Pure/pattern.ML`, with all its extensions and shortcuts, as HOL functions:

- **`Pure_Term.thy`:** Pure's `typ`/`term`, `Vartab` and `Envir.env`, plus the
  term operations of `term.ML`. ML exceptions are modelled as an exception
  monad; possible divergence uses `partial_function (option)`.
- **`Pure_Envir.thy`:** the sort algebra operations of `sorts.ML` (`sort_le`,
  `inter_sort`, `mg_domain`, `of_sort`), order-sorted type unification and
  matching (`Type.unify`, `Type.typ_match`), and the environment operations
  (`Envir.lookup`, `head_norm`, `genvar`, `norm_type`, …).
- **`Pure_Pattern.thy`:** a literal model of `pattern.ML`.
  - `unify`, with projections, the two flex-flex cases, on-the-fly
    η-expansion, the occurs check and failure tracing.
  - `match`, with fallback to `first_order_match`, and `pattern`.
- **`Pure_Pattern_Code.thy`:** `code_printing` maps the model onto Pure's own
  ML types, so the generated code works directly on Isabelle's terms and
  environments. Tables map onto `Vartab`, the class algebra onto
  `Sorts.algebra`.
- **`pattern_wrapper.ML`:** a thin functor implementing signature `PATTERN`.
  It translates the modelled exceptions into Pure's exceptions and reproduces
  the `unify_trace_failure` tracing.
- **`Pure_Pattern_Test.thy`:** loads the generated code with `code_reflect`
  and compares it with Pure's `Pattern`. The problems are about 190,000
  unification and 110,000 matching problems taken from the theorems of HOL
  (resolution-like premise/conclusion pairs, flexible premises, rules against
  variants of themselves, equations against subterms). Results, including the
  exceptions raised, must agree exactly.
- **`make_pattern_ML`:** assembles `generated/pattern.ML`, a drop-in
  replacement for `src/Pure/pattern.ML` (generated code plus wrapper).

The only unverified parts are the `code_printing` of the abstract operations
(tables, class relation, arities, `Name.aT`) and the wrapper.

## Layout

- `thys/`: the Isabelle theories and the `ROOT` file (session `HOPAT`):
  - `Lemmas.thy`: Facts 5–14 and Lemmas 15–23 on de Bruijn terms.
  - `Unif_Prelims.thy`, `Unif_Normal.thy`: substitutions, patterns,
    β-normal forms, normal forms and typing.
  - `Unification.thy`: the algorithm.
  - `Unif_Termination.thy`: the termination proof.
  - `Unif_Occurs.thy`: the occurs check.
  - `Unif_Correctness.thy`: the correctness proof.
  - The substitution lemma in three styles (de Bruijn, Nominal, Nominal2),
    for comparison.
  - `Pure_Pattern/`: the formalization of `src/Pure/pattern.ML`
    (session `Pure_Pattern`).
- `thesis/`: LaTeX sources of the thesis
- `literature/`: background material

## Checking the theories

The theories check with Isabelle2026 and the matching AFP release (needed for
`Nominal2_Substitution_Lemma`):

    isabelle build -d thys -v HOPAT

The session has `HOL` as its parent and loads `HOL-Library`, `HOL-Nominal`,
`HOL-Proofs-Lambda` (for `Commutation` and `ListOrder`) and the AFP entry
`Nominal2` from source, so it does not need a prebuilt `HOL-Proofs` heap.
The session contains no `sorry`.

To work on the theories interactively:

    isabelle jedit -d thys -l HOL thys/Unif_Correctness.thy

The original development targeted an older Isabelle release (Bitbucket
`traytel/hopat`, commit `7e1efe571684`).
